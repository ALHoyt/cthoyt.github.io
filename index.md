I'm a bio/cheminformatician applying knowledge graph embedding methodologies to
biological knowledge graphs to generate a variety of biological hypotheses to
assist in drug discovery and precision medicine.

What is **Biopragmatics**?
In language, semantics describe the names and meanings of words. The
bioinformatics community has aptly adopted *biosemantics* as a concept that
encompasses the issues with the names and meanings of biological entities,
usually in natural language processing and data integration. However, semantics
does not capture the context of words, and *biosemantics* fails to describe the
biological context and complex relationships between biological entities. 
Pragmatics goes beyond semantics and describes the context of words. Because of
this parallelism, I've begun to use the term *biopragmatics* to describe the
family of computational approaches aimed at identifying and contextualizing
the context of biological entities.
