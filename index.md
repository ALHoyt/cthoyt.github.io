I'm a bio/cheminformatician applying knowledge graph embedding methodologies to
biological knowledge graphs to generate a variety of biological hypotheses to
assist in drug discovery and precision medicine.

What is **Biopragmatics**?
In language, semantics describe the names and meanings of words. The
bioinformatics community has aptly adopted *biosemantics* as a name that
encompasses the issues faced in natural language processing and data
integration. However, semantics does not capture the context of words,
and *biosemantics* fails to describe the biological context and complex
relationships between biological entities. Pragmatics is the next level
that captures exactly this, so I'm beginning to use *biopragmatics* to
describe the family of computational approaches towards this goal.

Here's some details about my [research](/research.md), [teaching](/teaching.md),
